## Install

The npm package is **`posty-cli`**. The command it provides is `posty` — the
package name and the command name are deliberately different, because
**`npm install -g posty` installs somebody else's package**: the bare name
`posty` on npmjs.com belongs to an unrelated UK-postcode library. Never run it
and never tell a user to.

Install it from npm:

```bash
npm install -g posty-cli
posty auth:login          # opens the browser to approve the login
```

To work from a clone instead — only if you are changing the CLI itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/norbertlevente/posty-agent.git
cd posty-agent
pnpm install && pnpm run build
npm link                  # provides the `posty` command
```

API base: https://api.posty.hu (also served at https://posty.hu/api)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **name** | posty |
| **description** | CLI for scheduling and publishing posts through the Posty public API |
| **allowed-tools** | Bash(posty:*) |

---

## Which channels you can publish to

**Only these. Do not offer a user anything else, and do not try to post to it.**
Posty's server carries inherited code for many more providers; that code is not
enabled and not supported.

| Channel | `identifier` |
|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | `x` |
| Facebook (Pages) | `facebook` |
| Instagram | `instagram` |
| Instagram (standalone login) | `instagram-standalone` |
| Threads | `threads` |
| Bluesky | `bluesky` |

**`integrations:list` is the truth.** The table says what Posty supports; that
command says what THIS user has actually connected. Check it before you
schedule anything, and never post to an id that is not in its output.

**Never assume another provider exists.** If a user asks for Mastodon, Reddit,
Pinterest, Discord, Telegram, Slack, Medium, Dev.to, WordPress, Tumblr,
Farcaster or anything else, the answer is that Posty does not offer it. Do not
build a `--settings` payload for it.

---

## ⚠️ Two Hard Rules (Read First)

**Rule 1 — Authenticate before anything.** All commands fail without valid credentials.

**Rule 2 — Every file passed to `-m` (or to `image`/media fields in JSON mode) MUST first go through `posty upload`.** Raw filesystem paths (`image.jpg`, `video.mp4`) and external URLs (`https://example.com/...`) are **NOT** accepted by the publishing pipeline. TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and most other providers reject anything that isn't a Posty-verified URL. Always:

```bash
RESULT=$(posty upload <file>)
URL=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.path')
posty posts:create ... -m "$URL" ...
```

If you see `-m "something.jpg"` anywhere below, treat it as shorthand for "the `.path` you got back from `posty upload something.jpg`" — never a raw local file.

---

## Output contract

Every command prints its **JSON result — and nothing else — to stdout**;
status lines, warnings and errors go to stderr, and every failure exits 1. So
`posty upload x.jpg | jq -r '.path'` is always safe, with no stripping needed.
Unknown flags are an error, not silently ignored — if a flag is rejected, it
does not exist; do not retry with variations.

---

## ⚠️ Authentication Required

**You MUST authenticate before running any Posty CLI command.** All commands will fail without valid credentials.

Before doing anything else, check auth status:
```bash
posty auth:status
```

If not authenticated, either:
1. **Device login:** `posty auth:login` — opens a browser, the human approves it
2. **API Key:** `export POSTY_API_KEY=your_api_key`

**Do NOT proceed with any other commands until authentication is confirmed.**

### What a key can and cannot do

Keys are **per person, named, and scoped**. They are stored hashed and shown
exactly once, at creation, in the web app under **Settings → Developers**. A
lost key cannot be recovered — only rotated.

Two limits apply to every request, and both explain 403s that look like bugs:

1. **Scopes.** A key carries a subset of `posts:read`, `posts:draft`,
   `posts:publish`, `channels:read`, `channels:write`, `media:write`,
   `analytics:read`. A route refuses a key that lacks its scope.
2. **The owner's current role, re-checked on every request.** A key can never
   do more than the person who created it can do *right now*. If that person is
   demoted, their live keys narrow on the next request, with nobody revoking
   anything. So a key that worked yesterday can legitimately start returning
   403 today with no change to the key.

A key can also be **granted only some workspaces and only some channels**. A
request naming a channel outside the grant is refused even when the scope is
right.

**When you hit a 403, read the message.** It names the missing scope. Do not
retry, and do not try a different route to get around it — ask the user to mint
a key with the scope, or to have someone with the right role do it.

---

## Core Workflow

The fundamental pattern for using Posty CLI:

1. **Authenticate** - Verify or set up authentication (see above)
2. **Discover** - List integrations and get their settings
3. **Fetch** - Use integration tools to retrieve dynamic data (only Instagram has one: `audioSearch`)
4. **Prepare** - Upload media files if needed
5. **Post** - Create posts with content, media, and platform-specific settings
6. **Analyze** - Track performance with platform and post-level analytics
7. **Resolve** - If analytics returns `{"missing": true}`, run `posts:missing` to list provider content, then `posts:connect` to link it

```bash
# 1. Authenticate
posty auth:status
# If not authenticated: posty auth:login   (no client id/secret — it is a device flow)

# 2. Discover
posty integrations:list
posty integrations:settings <integration-id>

# 3. Fetch (if needed)
posty integrations:trigger <integration-id> <method> -d '{"key":"value"}'

# 4. Prepare
posty upload image.jpg
#    or, when the file is on the person's phone / not on this machine:
posty upload:link            # show the url to the person, they drop the files
posty upload:files <id>      # what arrived; use each .path in -m

# 5. Post
posty posts:create -c "Content" -m "image.jpg" -i "<integration-id>"

# 6. Analyze
posty analytics:platform <integration-id> -d 30
posty analytics:post <post-id> -d 7

# 7. Resolve (if analytics returns {"missing": true})
posty posts:missing <post-id>
posty posts:connect <post-id> --release-id "<content-id>"
```

---

## Essential Commands

### Authentication

**Option 1: Device login (recommended)**
```bash
# Opens a browser. No client ID or secret — the human approves the code shown.
posty auth:login

# Check auth status (verifies credentials are still valid)
posty auth:status

# Logout (remove stored credentials)
posty auth:logout
```

How it works, so you can explain it if the user asks: the CLI calls
`POST /device/code`, prints a short user code and opens the approval page in
the browser, then polls `POST /device/token` until the human — signed in to
Posty — approves it and chooses which workspace and which channels the
resulting key may reach. This runs inside Posty's own backend; there is no
separate auth service.

Credentials land in `~/.posty/credentials.json` (`0600`, in a `0700`
directory) and take priority over `POSTY_API_KEY`. The token response also
carries the API base, so the CLI points itself at the right host without a
release.

On a TTY, a successful login also offers to save a **scheduling timezone**
(detected from the machine, confirmed by the human) into
`~/.posty/config.json`. Off-TTY — i.e. when you, an agent, run it — no prompt
appears: pass `--timezone` on date-taking commands, or run
`posty config:set timezone Europe/Budapest` once. See "Date Handling".

**Option 2: API Key**
```bash
export POSTY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
Mint it in the web app under **Settings → Developers**. It is shown once.

**Optional custom API URL:**
```bash
export POSTY_API_URL=https://api.posty.hu
```
`https://api.posty.hu` is live. The same API is also served under
`https://posty.hu/api`, which is the CLI's built-in fallback. Anything else you
may have read about `docs.posty.hu`, `cdn.posty.hu` or `mcp.posty.hu` is
wrong — those hostnames do not resolve.

### Upload link — when the file is not on this machine

`posty upload` needs the file on disk. When the person has it on their phone,
or you cannot see their filesystem, do NOT ask them to host it somewhere
public. Mint a link:

```bash
posty upload:link
# → {"id":"kR3mQ7xP2nLa","url":"https://posty.hu/feltoltes/…","expiresAt":"…"}
```

Show the `url` to the person verbatim and say: open it, drop the image or
video, come back and tell me it is done. It works signed out and on a phone.
When they say done:

```bash
posty upload:files kR3mQ7xP2nLa
# → {"status":"ready","count":1,"files":[{"id":"…","name":"clip.mp4","path":"https://…","type":"video"}]}
```

Pass each `path` to `posts:create -m`. `status: "empty"` is not an error: they
have not finished, or spoke before the last file landed. Ask them to check the
page says "uploaded" and run it again. The link lives two hours; mint a new one
if it expires.

### Rate limits

Tiered, **per key, per route, per hour**. Each route keeps its own bucket, so a
polling loop on `posts:list` cannot starve `posts:create`.

| Routes | Limit |
|---|---|
| Reads — `posts:list`, `integrations:list`, `integrations:groups`, `integrations:settings`, `posts:missing`, `posts:find-slot`, notifications | 600/h (the `API_LIMIT` default; production sets 600) |
| Publish and delete — `posts:create`, `posts:delete`, `posts:status`, `integrations:trigger` | 60/h |
| Analytics and channel refresh — `analytics:platform`, `analytics:post`, `/social/:integration` | 30/h |
| Uploads — `upload`, `upload-from-url` | 30/h |
| Upload links — `upload:link` 60/h, `upload:files` 600/h | |

The bucket is keyed on the hash of the presented key, so rotating a key starts
a fresh allowance and the old secret's allowance dies with it. Exceeding a
limit returns `429`. **Back off; do not retry in a tight loop** — a retry
storm just burns the next hour's allowance too.

### Integration Discovery

```bash
# List all connected integrations
posty integrations:list

# List integrations belonging to a specific group (customer)
posty integrations:list --group <group-id>

# List all groups (customers) as {id, name}
posty integrations:groups

# Get settings schema for specific integration
posty integrations:settings <integration-id>

# Trigger integration tool to fetch dynamic data
posty integrations:trigger <integration-id> <method-name>
posty integrations:trigger <integration-id> <method-name> -d '{"param":"value"}'
```

### Creating Posts

```bash
# Simple post (date is REQUIRED)
posty posts:create -c "Content" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" -i "integration-id"

# Draft post
posty posts:create -c "Content" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" -t draft -i "integration-id"

# Post with media (upload each file FIRST — see Rule 2)
IMG1=$(posty upload img1.jpg | jq -r '.path')
IMG2=$(posty upload img2.jpg | jq -r '.path')
posty posts:create -c "Content" -m "$IMG1,$IMG2" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" -i "integration-id"

# Post with comments (each with own media — every file uploaded first)
MAIN=$(posty upload main.jpg | jq -r '.path')
C1=$(posty upload comment1.jpg | jq -r '.path')
C2A=$(posty upload comment2.jpg | jq -r '.path')
C2B=$(posty upload comment3.jpg | jq -r '.path')
posty posts:create \
  -c "Main post" -m "$MAIN" \
  -c "First comment" -m "$C1" \
  -c "Second comment" -m "$C2A,$C2B" \
  -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  -i "integration-id"

# Multi-platform post
posty posts:create -c "Content" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" -i "$X_ID,$FB_ID,$THREADS_ID"

# Platform-specific settings
posty posts:create \
  -c "Content" \
  -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  --settings '{"who_can_reply_post":"everyone"}' \
  -i "$X_ID"

# Complex post from JSON file
posty posts:create --json post.json
```

### Managing Posts

```bash
# List posts (defaults to last 30 days to next 30 days)
posty posts:list

# List posts in date range
posty posts:list --startDate "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z" --endDate "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z"

# Delete post
posty posts:delete <post-id>

# Change post status (draft ↔ schedule)
posty posts:status <post-id> --status draft     # Move back to draft, terminates any running publish workflow
posty posts:status <post-id> --status schedule  # Promote a draft into the publishing queue (uses the post's stored date)
```

### Analytics

```bash
# Get platform analytics (default: last 7 days)
posty analytics:platform <integration-id>

# Get platform analytics for last 30 days
posty analytics:platform <integration-id> -d 30

# Get post analytics (default: last 7 days)
posty analytics:post <post-id>

# Get post analytics for last 30 days
posty analytics:post <post-id> -d 30
```

Returns an array of metrics (e.g. Followers, Impressions, Likes, Comments) with daily data points and percentage change over the period.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Missing Release ID Handling**

If `analytics:post` returns `{"missing": true}` instead of an analytics array, the post was published but the platform didn't return a usable post ID. You **must** resolve this before analytics will work:

```bash
# 1. analytics:post returns {"missing": true}
posty analytics:post <post-id>

# 2. Get available content from the provider
posty posts:missing <post-id>
# Returns: [{"id": "7321456789012345678", "url": "https://...cover.jpg"}, ...]

# 3. Connect the correct content to the post
posty posts:connect <post-id> --release-id "7321456789012345678"

# 4. Now analytics will work
posty analytics:post <post-id>
```

### Connecting Missing Posts

Some platforms (e.g. TikTok) don't return a post ID immediately after publishing. When this happens, the post's `releaseId` is set to `"missing"` and analytics are unavailable until resolved.

```bash
# List recent content from the provider for a post with missing release ID
posty posts:missing <post-id>

# Connect a post to its published content
posty posts:connect <post-id> --release-id "<content-id>"
```

Returns an empty array if the provider doesn't support this feature or if the post doesn't have a missing release ID.

### Media Upload

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Always upload files to Posty before using them in posts. Many platforms (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube) **require verified URLs** and will reject external links.

```bash
# Upload file and get URL
posty upload image.jpg

# EXACTLY EIGHT TYPES ARE ACCEPTED. Anything else returns 400 "Unsupported
# file type." — the server sniffs the magic bytes, so renaming the file does
# not help.
#
#   image/jpeg  image/png  image/gif  image/webp
#   image/avif  image/bmp  image/tiff              (max 10 MB)
#   video/mp4                                      (max 1 GB)
#
# NOT accepted: MOV, MKV, WEBM, AVI, SVG, PDF, DOC/DOCX, and every audio
# format. Convert first:  ffmpeg -i clip.mov -c:v libx264 -c:a aac clip.mp4
# See SUPPORTED_FILE_TYPES.md.

# Workflow: Upload → Extract URL → Use in post
VIDEO=$(posty upload video.mp4)
VIDEO_PATH=$(echo "$VIDEO" | jq -r '.path')
posty posts:create -c "Content" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" -m "$VIDEO_PATH" -i "tiktok-id"
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Discover & Use Integration Tools

**Most supported channels have no tools at all.** Of the channels in the table
at the top of this file, exactly one exposes a tool: Instagram. X, Facebook,
Threads, Bluesky, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok and Google Business Profile expose
none — `integrations:settings` returns an empty `tools` array for them, and
`integrations:trigger` on them returns `404 Tool not found`.

**Never guess a method name.** Read the `tools` array from
`integrations:settings` first; the `methodName` there is the only string
`integrations:trigger` will accept.

```bash
IG_ID=$(posty integrations:list | jq -r '.[] | select(.identifier=="instagram") | .id')

# What can this channel actually do?
posty integrations:settings "$IG_ID" | jq '.output.tools'
# [ { "methodName": "audioSearch", "description": "Search audio …", "dataSchema": [ … ] } ]
```

**Instagram — find audio for a Reel:**
```bash
# Empty query returns trending audio. type is "music" (default) or "original_sound".
AUDIO=$(posty integrations:trigger "$IG_ID" audioSearch -d '{"q":"lofi","type":"music"}')
AUDIO_ID=$(echo "$AUDIO" | jq -r '.output[0].id')

VIDEO=$(posty upload reel.mp4 | jq -r '.path')
posty posts:create \
  -c "Reel caption" \
  -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  --settings "{\"post_type\":\"post\",\"audio\":{\"id\":\"$AUDIO_ID\"}}" \
  -m "$VIDEO" \
  -i "$IG_ID"
```

### Pattern 2: Upload Media Before Posting

```bash
# Upload multiple files
VIDEO_RESULT=$(posty upload video.mp4)
VIDEO_PATH=$(echo "$VIDEO_RESULT" | jq -r '.path')

THUMB_RESULT=$(posty upload thumbnail.jpg)
THUMB_PATH=$(echo "$THUMB_RESULT" | jq -r '.path')

# Use in post
posty posts:create \
  -c "Check out my video!" \
  -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  -m "$VIDEO_PATH" \
  -i "tiktok-id"
```

### Pattern 3: Twitter Thread

```bash
# Upload every image first (Rule 2)
INTRO=$(posty upload intro.jpg | jq -r '.path')
P1=$(posty upload point1.jpg | jq -r '.path')
P2=$(posty upload point2.jpg | jq -r '.path')
OUTRO=$(posty upload outro.jpg | jq -r '.path')

posty posts:create \
  -c "🧵 Thread starter (1/4)" -m "$INTRO" \
  -c "Point one (2/4)" -m "$P1" \
  -c "Point two (3/4)" -m "$P2" \
  -c "Conclusion (4/4)" -m "$OUTRO" \
  -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  -d 5 \
  -i "$X_ID"
# -d is the delay between comments in MINUTES (here: 5 minutes)
```

### Pattern 4: Multi-Platform Campaign (different content per channel)

JSON mode takes the API's real request body — `type`, `date`, `shortLink`,
`tags`, and a `posts` array where each element names an `integration`, its
`value` thread and its `settings`. There is no `"integrations"` key and no
`"provider"` key; a full working file is
[examples/multi-platform-post.json](./examples/multi-platform-post.json).

```bash
IMG=$(posty upload sale.jpg | jq -r '.path')

cat > campaign.json << EOF
{
  "type": "schedule",
  "date": "2026-12-01T09:00:00Z",
  "shortLink": false,
  "tags": [],
  "posts": [
    {
      "integration": { "id": "<x-id>" },
      "value": [
        { "content": "Holiday sale! 🎄 20% off every plan. #sale", "image": [ { "id": "a", "path": "$IMG" } ] }
      ],
      "settings": { "who_can_reply_post": "everyone" }
    },
    {
      "integration": { "id": "<facebook-id>" },
      "value": [
        { "content": "Our holiday sale is live — 20% off every plan until the end of December. Details on the website!", "image": [ { "id": "b", "path": "$IMG" } ] }
      ],
      "settings": { "post_type": "post" }
    }
  ]
}
EOF

posty posts:create --json campaign.json
```

### Pattern 5: Validate Settings Before Posting

```bash
#!/bin/bash

INTEGRATION_ID="$X_ID"
CONTENT="Your post content here"

# Get integration settings and extract max length
SETTINGS_JSON=$(posty integrations:settings "$INTEGRATION_ID")
MAX_LENGTH=$(echo "$SETTINGS_JSON" | jq '.output.maxLength')

# Check character limit and truncate if needed
if [ ${#CONTENT} -gt "$MAX_LENGTH" ]; then
  echo "Content exceeds $MAX_LENGTH chars, truncating..."
  CONTENT="${CONTENT:0:$((MAX_LENGTH - 3))}..."
fi

# Create post with settings
posty posts:create \
  -c "$CONTENT" \
  -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  --settings '{"key": "value"}' \
  -i "$INTEGRATION_ID"
```

### Pattern 6: Batch Scheduling

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Schedule posts for the week
DATES=(
  "2026-02-14T09:00:00Z"
  "2026-02-15T09:00:00Z"
  "2026-02-16T09:00:00Z"
)

CONTENT=(
  "Monday motivation 💪"
  "Tuesday tips 💡"
  "Wednesday wisdom 🧠"
)

for i in "${!DATES[@]}"; do
  # Rule 2: upload each file before passing to -m
  IMG=$(posty upload "post-${i}.jpg" | jq -r '.path')
  posty posts:create \
    -c "${CONTENT[$i]}" \
    -s "${DATES[$i]}" \
    -i "$X_ID" \
    -m "$IMG"
  echo "Scheduled: ${CONTENT[$i]} for ${DATES[$i]}"
done
```

### Pattern 7: Error Handling & Retry

```bash
#!/bin/bash

CONTENT="Your post content"
INTEGRATION_ID="$X_ID"
DATE="2026-12-31T12:00:00Z"
MAX_RETRIES=3

for attempt in $(seq 1 $MAX_RETRIES); do
  if posty posts:create -c "$CONTENT" -s "$DATE" -i "$INTEGRATION_ID"; then
    echo "Post created successfully"
    break
  else
    echo "Attempt $attempt failed"
    if [ "$attempt" -lt "$MAX_RETRIES" ]; then
      DELAY=$((2 ** attempt))
      echo "Retrying in ${DELAY}s..."
      sleep "$DELAY"
    else
      echo "Failed after $MAX_RETRIES attempts"
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
done
```

## Technical Concepts

### Integration Tools Workflow

Some integrations expose a tool for data that cannot be hard-coded. Among supported channels only Instagram does. The workflow:

1. **Check available tools** - `integrations:settings` returns a `tools` array
2. **Review tool schema** - Each tool has `methodName`, `description`, and `dataSchema`
3. **Trigger tool** - Call `integrations:trigger` with required parameters
4. **Use output** - Tool returns data to use in post settings

**Tools on supported channels, exhaustively:**

| Channel | Tools |
|---|---|
| Instagram (`instagram`) | `audioSearch` |
| Instagram standalone, X, Facebook, Threads, Bluesky, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, Google Business Profile | *(none)* |

That is the whole list. There is no `getPlaylists`, no `getCompanies`, no
`getBoards`, no `getFlairs` — earlier versions of this file invented all four,
and `integrations:trigger` answers `404 Tool not found` for every one of them.

### Provider Settings Structure

Platform-specific settings use a discriminator pattern with `__type` field:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "provider": "youtube",
      "post": [{ "content": "Video description", "image": [...] }],
      "settings": {
        "__type": "youtube",
        "title": "Video title",
        "type": "public",
        "selfDeclaredMadeForKids": "no",
        "tags": [{ "value": "tech", "label": "Tech" }]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Pass settings directly:
```bash
posty posts:create -c "Content" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" --settings '{"title":"…","type":"public"}' -i "youtube-id"
# Backend automatically adds "__type" based on integration ID
```

Channels with **no settings of their own** — Threads and Bluesky — take an
empty object. Do not invent fields for them.

**You never have to write `__type` yourself.** The server stamps it from the
integration's provider before validating, overwriting whatever you sent. An
example file carrying `"__type": "EmptySettings"` still works for that reason —
it is being replaced, not accepted.

### Two behaviours that surprise people

**1. A key without `posts:publish` silently produces a draft.** `posts:create`
requires only `posts:draft`. If the key (or its owner's current role — a
Közreműködő/DRAFTER) lacks `posts:publish`, the server coerces `type` to
`draft` and creates a draft instead of refusing. It is not silent in the
response: **read back the `type` you got, do not assume the one you sent.**
If the user wanted it published, tell them the key cannot, rather than
reporting success.

**2. One X channel per post, always.** A single post may not target two X
channels, whatever the content. X's Developer Policy forbids substantially
similar content from multiple accounts through one developer app, and the
account at risk is Posty's, shared by every customer. Split it into two posts.
X alongside Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Bluesky, YouTube and the rest is
unaffected — that combination is the entire point.

### Comments and Threading

Posts can have comments (threads on Twitter/X, replies elsewhere). Each comment can have its own media:

```bash
# Upload every file first (Rule 2)
I1=$(posty upload image1.jpg | jq -r '.path')
I2=$(posty upload image2.jpg | jq -r '.path')
CI=$(posty upload comment-img.jpg | jq -r '.path')
A1=$(posty upload another.jpg | jq -r '.path')
A2=$(posty upload more.jpg | jq -r '.path')

posty posts:create \
  -c "Main post" -m "$I1,$I2" \
  -c "Comment 1" -m "$CI" \
  -c "Comment 2" -m "$A1,$A2" \

Internally creates (note: every URL is a Posty-uploaded `.path`, not a raw filename):
```json
{
  "posts": [{
    "value": [
      { "content": "Main post", "image": ["<uploaded image1>", "<uploaded image2>"] },
      { "content": "Comment 1", "image": ["<uploaded comment-img>"], "delay": 5 },
      { "content": "Comment 2", "image": ["<uploaded another>", "<uploaded more>"], "delay": 5 }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Date Handling

**The contract: ALWAYS pass an explicit offset, or pass `--timezone` with an
IANA name.** The CLI never guesses a timezone. The server reads a naive
datetime as UTC, which silently shifts a Hungarian "12:00" by one or two
hours — so the CLI refuses ambiguity instead.

The two safe forms:

```bash
-s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z"                                  # explicit UTC
-s "2026-12-31 12:00" --timezone Europe/Budapest           # wall-clock + IANA zone
```

How a date is resolved, in priority order:

1. **Explicit offset in the string** (`Z`, `+01:00`) — used as written.
2. **`--timezone <IANA name>`** on `posts:create` / `posts:list`.
3. **`POSTY_TIMEZONE`** environment variable (IANA name).
4. **The saved config** — `posty config:set timezone Europe/Budapest`
   (also offered interactively during `posty auth:login` on a TTY).
5. **None of the above and the date is naive → hard error, exit 1.** The
   error names all four fixes. Do not retry the same naive date; add a
   timezone.

Rules and behaviors:

- Timezone values must be IANA names (`Europe/Budapest`, `UTC`). **Numeric
  offsets (`+02:00`, `UTC+2`, `Etc/GMT+2`) are rejected as timezone values**
  — never hand-compute DST; put an offset inside the date string only when
  you are certain of it, otherwise use the IANA name and let the CLI convert
  (DST-aware).
- Whenever a timezone is applied (steps 2–4), the CLI echoes the resolved
  UTC instant on stderr:
  `ℹ️  Interpreted "2026-12-24 18:00" as Europe/Budapest (via --timezone) → 2026-12-24T17:00:00.000Z`
- A bare date (`"2026-12-31"`) means midnight in the resolved timezone.
- `posts:list --startDate/--endDate` accept the same shapes and the same
  `--timezone` flag; the defaults (30 days back / 30 days forward) never
  need a timezone.
- `posty config:get` / `posty config:get timezone` shows what is saved;
  settings live in `~/.posty/config.json` and survive `auth:logout`.
- `posty posts:find-slot <integration-id>` returns `{"date": "..."}` — the
  next free slot on that channel's schedule; pass it straight back to
  `posts:create -s`.
- `-t now` publishes immediately and needs no `--date`.

### Media Upload Response

Upload returns JSON with path and metadata:
```json
{
  "path": "https://posty.hu/uploads/2026/08/abc123.jpg",
  "size": 123456,
  "type": "image/jpeg"
}
```

Extract path for use in posts:
```bash
RESULT=$(posty upload image.jpg)
PATH=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.path')
posty posts:create -c "Content" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" -m "$PATH" -i "integration-id"
```

### JSON Mode vs CLI Flags

**CLI flags** - Quick posts:
```bash
posty posts:create -c "Content" -m "$(posty upload img.jpg | jq -r '.path')" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" -i "$X_ID"
```

**JSON mode** - Complex posts with multiple platforms and settings:
```bash
posty posts:create --json post.json
```

JSON mode supports:
- Multiple platforms with different content per platform
- Complex provider-specific settings
- Scheduled posts
- Posts with many comments
- Custom delay between comments

---

## Platform-Specific Examples

Every field below is taken from the server's validation DTOs. A field that is
not listed does not exist, and sending it is a `400`.

### X (Twitter) — `x`
```bash
posty posts:create \
  -c "Tweet content" \
  -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  --settings '{"who_can_reply_post":"everyone"}' \
  -i "$X_ID"
```
`who_can_reply_post` is **required**: `everyone` | `following` |
`mentionedUsers` | `subscribers` | `verified`. Optional: `community` (must
match `https://x.com/i/communities/<digits>`), `made_with_ai` (bool),
`paid_partnership` (bool).

### Facebook — `facebook`
```bash
IMG=$(posty upload photo.jpg | jq -r '.path')
posty posts:create \
  -c "Post text" \
  -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  --settings '{"post_type":"post"}' \
  -m "$IMG" \
  -i "$FB_ID"
```
All optional: `post_type` (`post` | `story`), `url`, `text_format_preset_id`
(a background for a **text-only** post; Pages only, ~130 characters max).

### Instagram — `instagram` / `instagram-standalone`
```bash
IMG=$(posty upload image.jpg | jq -r '.path')

# Feed post
posty posts:create -c "Caption #hashtag" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  --settings '{"post_type":"post"}' -m "$IMG" -i "$IG_ID"

# Story
STORY=$(posty upload story.jpg | jq -r '.path')
posty posts:create -c "" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" \
  --settings '{"post_type":"story"}' -m "$STORY" -i "$IG_ID"
```
`post_type` is **required**: `post` | `story`. Optional: `collaborators` (array
of `{label}`), `audio` (`{id, title?, artist?, image?, audio_volume?,
video_volume?}` — get the `id` from the `audioSearch` tool), `is_trial_reel`,
`graduation_strategy` (`MANUAL` | `SS_PERFORMANCE`).

### Threads — `threads`, and Bluesky — `bluesky`
```bash
posty posts:create -c "Post text" -s "2026-12-31T12:00:00Z" -i "$THREADS_ID"
```
No provider settings. Omit `--settings` entirely.

## What Posty does NOT do

State these plainly rather than attempting a workaround.

- **No AI video generation.** The `/generate-video` and `/video/function`
  routes were removed from the API entirely (2026-08-06). Do not tell a user
  Posty can generate video, and do not call those routes — they 404.
- **No image or video generation of any kind through this CLI.** Media comes
  from files the user already has, via `posty upload`.
- **No channel deletion.** `DELETE /integrations/:id` was deliberately removed
  from the public API. Disconnecting a channel is a signed-in, admin action in
  the web app.
- **Nothing outside the channel table at the top of this file.**

## Common Gotchas

1. **Not authenticated** - Run `posty auth:login` or `export POSTY_API_KEY=key` before using CLI
2. **Invalid integration ID** - Run `integrations:list` to get current IDs
3. **Settings schema mismatch** - Check `integrations:settings` for required fields
4. **Media MUST be uploaded to Posty first** - ⚠️ **CRITICAL (Rule 2):** Every value passed to `-m` or to an `image`/media field in JSON mode must be a `.path` returned by `posty upload`. Raw local filenames (`image.jpg`) and external URLs (`https://...`) will be rejected — TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and most other providers only accept Posty-verified URLs. No exceptions: even a "quick test post" needs the upload step.
5. **JSON escaping in shell** - Use single quotes for JSON: `--settings '{...}'`
6. **Date format** - ISO 8601 with an explicit offset (`"2026-12-31T12:00:00Z"`), or a naive datetime plus `--timezone <IANA name>`. A naive datetime with no timezone configured is a hard error. Required except with `-t now` or `--json`.
7. **Tool not found** - Check available tools in `integrations:settings` output
8. **Character limits** - Each platform has different limits, check `maxLength` in settings
9. **Required settings** - YouTube requires `title` and `type`; X requires `who_can_reply_post`; Instagram requires `post_type`; TikTok requires `privacy_level` and `content_posting_method`. Threads and Bluesky require nothing.
10. **Media MIME types** - CLI auto-detects from file extension, ensure correct extension
11. **Analytics returns `{"missing": true}`** - The post was published but the platform didn't return a post ID. Run `posts:missing <post-id>` to get available content, then `posts:connect <post-id> --release-id "<id>"` to link it. Analytics will work after connecting.
